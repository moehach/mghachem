          <p>
            Thawra, or revolution. Design is an important part of voicing civil
            dissent towards the state a country is in. As a strong believer of
            creating socially responsible, and socially responsive design, I saw
            it as my duty to contribute to the overwhelming voice of dissent
            sparking across my country, Lebanon.

            These are designs created for several social media accounts across

        <div class="col-12">

          <h3>The State of Affairs</h3>
          <p>
            This first series takes on popular phrases heard throughout the
            initial phases of the protests between the 17th and 22nd of October.
            The issues highlighted the designs and illustrations try to go past
            the obvious phrase and points at different issues facing Lebanon.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first design takes on the phrase "It's time to abort you". In Arabic the
            actual meaning of this phrase signifies "it's time you make you fall". Using the
            play on word between the double meaning of the word Nsa’etkon, the design points
            at the fact that women across Lebanon are not given their complete rights over
            their own bodies.
          </p>


          <p>

            The second design says "the dose finished", in this context it’s a
            nod to a popular phrase during the protests "the morphine dose that
            kept us, the people, drugged no longer affects us". The design is
            gives another nod towards a huge medical crisis occurring in
            Lebanon, where medical supplies are at risk of running out
            completely.
          </p>

          <p>
            The third design plays on two different meanings: "The revolution is the
            pulse of the nation" and "The nation yelled out 'revolution'". This is one of
            those phrases that really brings out the beauty of Arabic as a language where
            depending on how you pronounce or stress the words, you've created a whole new
            meaning to the body of text.

          <h3>Oudak Ranan</h3>

          <p>
            This series takes on lyrics from a popular song by Fayrouz called
            "Oudak Ranan" ("Your Lute is Sonorous") as a basis for the text.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first design depicts the usages of a pot, in reference to the
            "cacerolazo" protests. The line here says "Bang, keep banging, wake
            everyone up".
          </p>

          <p>
            The second design uses a frying pan and ladel that depict the time
            (set at 8:00pm) that protestors agreed to bang their pots to voice
            their dissent. The phrase here says "The night isn't made for sleep,
            the night is for staying up".
          </p>

          <p>
            The phrase here states "You're the musician, you're the one with
            good taste, make them fly" which can also me translated as "You're the
            accurate one, you're the one with good taste, swat them".

          <h3>No, YOU leave.</h3>
          <p>
            This design came as a reaction to a live speech by the President of
            Lebanon, where he said "if the protestors cannot find a good person
            to represent them within the (current) state (political structure),
            then they should emigrate". Many protestors took the statement as a
            personal attack since the vast majority of Lebanese live in
            diaspora. While the Presidency redacted the statement and tried to
            correct it, the damage had already been done among the local
            populace.
          </p>

          <p>
            The numbers listed in the ticket hint at specific dates in the
            history of the current President's political career that were, to
            say the least - moments of failure.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Many designers, and people alike, might say "Oh I don't like
          politics", but at the end of the day politics is an integral part of
          our lives. Does everything need to be politicized? Of course not,
          but if you can help your fellow humans by highlighting issues that
          they're facing, then why not at least try to do so, especially if
          there are no constraints on your shoulders?
        </p>

        <p>
          As visual communicators, I believe that we have a responsibility to
          highlight social issues when we are able to do so. Design can be a
          powerful tool that can empower people who are facing injustice
          regardless of their ethnicity, creed, sexuality, or their stance
          towards tabbouleh.
